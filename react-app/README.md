# Gap Zero

Gap Zero is an AI-powered learning platform designed to identify and bridge foundational learning gaps for students who missed formal education.

## Mission

The system evaluates what the learner knows, detects missing prerequisites, and builds a reverse learning path from their goal back to the fundamentals — without shame, pressure, or rigid classrooms.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
